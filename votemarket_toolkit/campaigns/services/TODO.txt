- User oriented (for a campaign (gauge), periods, state of proofs)
- VBM helper (Input token, input gauges, will get current price, current $/vote on the round for the others gauges, historical $/vote on that gauge + prev bounties periods , and compute ideal params)



- Better split of services (comments etc)
