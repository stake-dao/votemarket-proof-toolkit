## Campaign Creation

> [!NOTE]
> VoteMarket V2 introduces a new cross-chain campaign creation flow. Below is a comparison between V1 and V2:

<table>
<tr>
<th>VoteMarket V1</th>
<th>VoteMarket V2</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<img src="../assets/votemarket_v1_creation.png" alt="VoteMarket V1 Campaign Creation" width="400"/>
</td>
<td>
<img src="../assets/votemarket_v2_creation.png" alt="VoteMarket V2 Campaign Creation" width="400"/>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Key differences in V2:
- msg.value (CCIP fees)
- Different signature (additional gas limt for CCIP - L2 / destination chain, hook address)

For detailed implementation:
- [L1 Token Campaigns (Ethereum â†’ L2)](guides/campaign_creation.md#l1-token-campaigns-ethereum)
- [L2 Token Campaigns (Directly on L2)](guides/campaign_creation.md#l2-token-campaigns-native-l2)

## Campaign Management

- [Update Campaign Epoch](guides/campaign_management.md#update-campaign-epoch)
- [From L1](guides/campaign_management.md#from-l1)
- [From L2](guides/campaign_management.md#from-l2)

## Campaign Closing

## Claiming Campaign Rewards

- [Storage Proofs](guides/claiming_rewards.md#storage-proofs)

## Using the Bundler for Batch Operations

The Bundler contract (`0x67346f8b9B7dDA4639600C190DDaEcDc654359c8`) provides multicall functionality to batch multiple operations in a single transaction. This is particularly useful for:

### Proof Submissions
Batch multiple proof submissions together:
- `setBlockData`
- `setPointData`
- `setAccountData`

### Claims
- Submit multiple claims in a single transaction
- Combine proof submissions with claims

#### Update Epochs
- Update multiple epochs in a single transaction
- Combine proof submissions with epoch updates

> [!TIP]
> An usage of the bundler is present in the `claim_rewards.py` script in the `examples/` directory.
